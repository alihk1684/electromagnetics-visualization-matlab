# Electromagnetics Field Simulation – MATLAB

This repository contains MATLAB codes developed for my undergraduate **Electromagnetics course project**.

The objective of this project was to numerically compute and visualize electric and magnetic fields using fundamental electromagnetic laws, and compare numerical results with analytical solutions where possible.

# Project Overview

The project consists of four main parts:

- **Q1** – Electric field of a uniformly charged sphere  
- **Q2** – Electric potential and field of point charges  
- **Q3** – Laplace equation between two conical surfaces  
- **Q4** – Magnetic field of a circular current loop  

Each part focuses on translating electromagnetic theory into numerical simulation and visualization.

# Q1 – Uniformly Charged Sphere (Gauss’s Law)

### Objective
Compute and visualize the electric field of:
- A solid sphere with uniform charge density
- A hollow spherical shell

### Concept
Using Gauss’s Law:
- Inside solid sphere → field increases linearly with radius
- Outside sphere → field decreases as 1/r²
- Inside hollow shell → field is zero

### Code
`Q1.m`:
- Computes enclosed charge
- Computes electric field analytically
- Plots field vs radius
- Generates 3D visualization
